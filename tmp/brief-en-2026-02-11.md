1) Korea FSS targets crypto market manipulation; sets up Digital Asset Basic Act prep team (incl. stablecoins)
- Summary: Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) announced planned investigations into high-risk crypto market misconduct (e.g., whale-driven manipulation, “gated pool” tactics, and misinformation) and plans to build AI-assisted detection. It also formed a prep team for the upcoming “Digital Asset Basic Act,” including disclosure standards and licensing-review manuals for digital-asset businesses and stablecoin issuers.
- Why it matters: Korea is moving from reactive enforcement to systemized supervision—important for exchange integrity and any future KRW-linked stablecoin regime.

2) FSS escalates Bithumb incident review to a formal inspection after large BTC mispayment
- Summary: Korea’s FSS escalated its on-site check into a formal inspection after Bithumb’s large-scale Bitcoin mispayment incident. The report notes Bithumb reconciled internal ledgers vs. wallet balances once daily (next-day), which may prompt tighter custody, reconciliation, and internal-control standards for centralized exchanges.
- Why it matters: Stricter reconciliation/custody standards can raise compliance costs and reshape how Korean exchanges—and their banking partners—operate.

1) CFTC staff updates “payment stablecoin” definition to include national trust banks (margin collateral context)
- Summary: The CFTC’s Market Participants Division reissued Staff Letter 25-40 with a limited revision so that a national trust bank can qualify as a permitted issuer of a “payment stablecoin” under the staff no-action position.
- Why it matters: Broadening eligible issuer types can accelerate institutional adoption of stablecoins in regulated derivatives/clearing plumbing.

2) Deel + MoonPay partner to enable compliant stablecoin salary payouts (UK/EU first, US later)
- Summary: Deel and MoonPay announced a partnership to support salary payments in stablecoins to users’ non-custodial wallets, with rollout starting in the UK/EU and a second phase planned for the US.
- Why it matters: Payroll is a “sticky” distribution rail; mainstream HR/payroll integration can increase real-world stablecoin velocity and demand.

3) US stablecoin policy talks remain focused on “yield/rewards” (market-structure implications)
- Summary: Reporting around a Feb. 10 White House stakeholder meeting suggests “stablecoin yield/rewards” remains a major sticking point for broader US crypto market-structure efforts.
- Why it matters: If policymakers restrict stablecoin rewards, it affects distribution incentives (exchanges, wallets) and downstream DeFi integrations.

[Watchlist]
- Korea: Post-Bithumb inspection guidance on reconciliation frequency, custody controls, and “real asset holding” expectations.
- US: Whether “stablecoin rewards/yield” is treated like bank interest vs. rebates/loyalty programs.

[One-liner]
Korea is tightening exchange oversight after a high-profile incident, while globally stablecoins keep expanding into payroll rails as regulators refine definitions and debate whether rewards are bank-like interest.
