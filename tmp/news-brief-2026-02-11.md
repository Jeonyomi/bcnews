1) Title: South Korea’s stablecoin framework debate drags as FSC misses deadline
Summary: South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) reportedly missed a government-requested deadline to submit a won-pegged stablecoin bill, saying it needed more coordination with other agencies. The article describes ongoing tension with the Bank of Korea over issuer eligibility and approval powers.
Why it matters: Korea’s timeline and final issuer rules will determine who can issue KRW stablecoins (banks vs fintech/big tech), shaping market structure for domestic stablecoin rails.

2) Title: Korean market prepares "wallet wave" ahead of won-stablecoin rules
Summary: Biometric Update reports that Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA) is expected to be published before March and may extend obligations (AML/CTF, issuer duties) to won-pegged stablecoins and related digital assets. The piece notes pilots and integrations by major financial groups and wallet ecosystems.
Why it matters: If DABA lands with strict compliance and identity requirements, wallet providers and issuers may face higher onboarding/monitoring costs—but also clearer legal footing for stablecoin payments.

3) Title: Banks vs fintech race to build KRW-stablecoin infrastructure as DABA nears
Summary: KoreaTechDesk outlines how banks and fintechs are positioning for potential authorization of KRW-backed stablecoin issuance under a forthcoming Digital Asset Basic Act, including debates around a "bank-majority (51%)" issuer structure. It highlights industry events and pilots framed around cross-border settlement and FX.
Why it matters: The issuer-eligibility decision and compliance architecture will influence competition, fees, and whether stablecoin settlement becomes a mainstream cross-border tool for Korea.

1) Title: White House talks between banks and crypto fail to resolve stablecoin "yield/reward" dispute
Summary: A White House follow-up meeting reportedly ended without agreement as banks pushed for restrictions on stablecoin rewards, arguing they resemble deposit interest and could accelerate deposit outflows. Crypto industry representatives opposed an outright ban and tied the dispute to broader market-structure legislation (CLARITY Act).
Why it matters: Whether stablecoin rewards are permitted (and under what rules) directly impacts stablecoin distribution, wallet competition, and bank/fintech balance in the U.S.

2) Title: Hong Kong plans first stablecoin licenses in March under new ordinance
Summary: Eudaimonia & Co reports that Hong Kong intends to proceed with initial stablecoin licenses in March under its stablecoin ordinance, with the HKMA accepting applications and framing stablecoins for use cases like cross-border payments and tokenized deposit systems. The piece notes Beijing’s broader skepticism toward private crypto activity.
Why it matters: HK licensing is a key "regulated stablecoin hub" signal in Asia and could influence where issuers domicile and how banks integrate tokenized deposits/stablecoins.

3) Title: EU drafts sanctions package that expands crypto-related restrictions tied to Russia
Summary: EU Today summarizes reporting that the European Commission is considering broader prohibitions/restrictions on crypto transactions linked to Russia as part of a new sanctions package, including references to digital-ruble transactions and stablecoin/payment infrastructure. Adoption would require member-state approval.
Why it matters: Broader sanctions language can push exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and compliance teams toward stricter screening, geofencing, and transaction monitoring across Europe.

4) Title: Goldman Sachs adjusts spot crypto ETF exposure (BTC/ETH down; XRP/SOL added)
Summary: Coinfomania reports (citing a 13F filing) that Goldman Sachs reduced holdings in spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Q4 2025 and added smaller positions in XRP and Solana ETF products. Positions are via regulated ETFs rather than direct token holdings.
Why it matters: Large-bank positioning via ETFs remains a key on-ramp for institutional crypto exposure and can affect liquidity and narratives for major assets adjacent to stablecoin market structure.

[Watchlist]

- U.S. stablecoin rewards / "yield" rulemaking: Watch for draft legislative text or regulator guidance that defines whether wallet/issuer rewards are permitted and under which consumer-protection and banking-equivalence constraints.
- South Korea DABA / Basic Digital Asset Act: Track the final issuer-eligibility standard (bank-led consortium vs broader licensing) and identity/AML obligations for issuers and wallet providers.
- Hong Kong HKMA stablecoin licensing (March): Monitor license recipients, reserve/custody requirements, redemption terms, and whether HKD-pegged stablecoins gain bank distribution.
- EU sanctions scope: Track whether the Commission’s proposed crypto restrictions (including any stablecoin/payment-rail language) are adopted as written and how CASPs implement compliance changes.

[One-liner]
Stablecoin policy debates (issuer eligibility and rewards) are becoming the main near-term "market structure" lever in both the U.S. and Korea, while Hong Kong and the EU push licensing/sanctions frameworks that will shape cross-border stablecoin usage.
